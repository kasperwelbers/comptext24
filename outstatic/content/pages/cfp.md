The Sixth **International and Interdisciplinary Conference on the Quantitative and Computational Analysis of Textual Data (COMPTEXT)** will be held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on 2-4 May 2024.

COMPTEXT is an international community of quantitative text analysis and computational social science scholars in political science, international relations and beyond. COMPTEXT 2024 in Amsterdam follows in the footsteps of previous conferences in Budapest (2018), Tokyo (2019) and Innsbruck (online, 2020), Dublin (2022), and Glasgow (2023). COMPTEXT conferences offer ample opportunities to network with computational scholars, to exchange technological knowledge of computational methods, and to obtain useful feedback on ongoing research.

For COMPTEXT 2024 in Amsterdam we are seeking paper submissions that:

- rely on image, video, text or other digital trace data to study social and political phenomena broadly construed

- propose or evaluate new computational methods or tools

- seek to make contributions at the intersection of social science and computer science

We accept both substantive and methodological papers for presentation: substantive papers may be on any studies in social sciences or humanities that utilize computational methods; methodological papers may describe new computational methods, tools and approaches.

In keeping with our tradition, ahead of the conference a series of methods training tutorials will be held for registered participants. Courses will be offered for both beginner and advanced level participants.

## Submission of Paper Abstracts:

Abstracts of max. 250 words and three substantive and/or methods-related keywords, should be submitted **by Wednesday 20 December 2023**.

**Notifications** of acceptance will be sent by **16 February, 2024**.

The **registration** deadline is **15 March, 2024**.

Please submit your paper at [https://forms.gle/VrzhEzJEcTNdM3RN9](https://forms.gle/VrzhEzJEcTNdM3RN9)

Please be advised that a conference fee will be charged for participants with accepted papers.

## Equality, Diversion, and Inclusion

COMPTEXT is committed to creating an inclusive conference where diversity is celebrated, and everyone is afforded equality of opportunity. We welcome applications from everyone, including those who identify with any of the protected characteristics that are set out in VU's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policy ([https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/diversity](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/diversity)). We especially encourage scholars from traditionally underrepresented groups, female scholars, and early-career researchers to apply.
